				<p>
					The title for this page came from a slip of my tongue.
					I actually had wanted to say "responsive and accessible" web applications,
					but somehow "responsible" slipped out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regardless of how I came up with the term, I do consider it to be fitting
					because I feel that we as developers have a responsibility to ensure that
					our application is responsive and accessible.
					If we don't, who will?
				</p>
				<p>
					It is extremely difficult and expensive to add responsiveness and accessibility after the fact.
					For this reason, we need to take them into account
					from the very beginning.
				</p>
				<p>
					Luckily, with modern HTML and CSS, we can create responsive and
					accessible web apps with relative ease. In my years of doing software development,
					I have learned some HTML and CSS tips and tricks, and I want to present these in
					this post. This list is not exhaustive, but these are tried and true patterns that
					I frequently use in different projects.
				</p>

				<h2 id="Responsive-Web-Design">Responsive Web Design<a href="#Responsive-Web-Design" aria-label="Link to Responsive Web Design"></a></h2>

				<p>Do we really need responsive web design for our web application? We will only use our web application on desktop computers!</p>

				<p>
					I've heard this argument many times, but in the long term, it has never turned out to be true.
					For this reason, I've created Joy's two laws of web development:
				</p>

				<h3 id="Joy’s-First-Law-of-Web-Development">Joy’s First Law of Web Development<a href="#Joy’s-First-Law-of-Web-Development" aria-label="Link to Joy's First Law of Web Development"></a></h3>
				<blockquote>
					<blockquote-quote aria-hidden="true"></blockquote-quote>
					<p>There is no such thing as a non-responsive web application</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p><em>Your web application WILL be opened in a mobile phone or tablet at some time in the future and your users WILL expect it to work correctly.</em></p>

				<h3 id="Joy’s-Second-Law-of-Web-Development">Joy’s Second Law of Web Development<a href="#Joy’s-Second-Law-of-Web-Development" aria-label="Link to Joy's Second Law of Web Development"></a></h3>
				<blockquote>
					<blockquote-quote aria-hidden="true"></blockquote-quote>
					Any work you do now to ensure that your web application behaves responsively WILL be appreciated in the future.
				</blockquote>

				<p>When it comes to the technical implementation of responsive design, there are two main categories of components that we need to develop:</p>
				<ul class="em-list negative-padding squishy-text">
					<li><a href="#Responsive-Layout-Containers">Responsive Layout Containers</a></li>
					<li aria-hidden="true" data-and>&</li>
					<li><a href="#Squishy-Components">Squishy Components</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>I want to cover these two aspects in the next sections</p>

				<h3 id="Responsive-Layout-Containers">Responsive Layout Containers<a href="#Responsive-Layout-Containers" aria-label="Link to Responsive Layout Containers"></a></h3>
				<p>
					We firstly need to make sure that we put a lot of thought into designing layout containers which adjust themselves based on the size of our viewport.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the following demo, we can see how we can define a layout conceptually using different grid areas.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<div class="horizontal-scroll responsive-example" aria-hidden="true">
						<span class="caption">Mobile Devices</span>

							<div class="main">
								Main Content

					</div>
					<figcaption>
						A UI example showing how content will be stacked vertically on smaller devices,
						but on larger viewports we can then use the increased horizontal space to display
						certain content areas next to each other.
						<p class="visually-hidden">
							The demo shows five content areas: Header, Sidebar, Main Content, Second Sidebar, and Footer.
							On a mobile device, these areas are shown vertically stacked.
							On larger viewports, the example layout now has three rows and three columns.
							The Header area spans the full width of the top of the viewport in the first row.
							In the middle row, the Sidebar, Main Content, and Second Sidebar areas are positioned
							next to each other in a three column layout, with the Main Content area expanding
							to take up as much space as it can. The Footer area then spans the full width of
							the viewport in the bottom row of the layout.
						</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>How can we implement this? To do this, I like to use the following technique.</p>
				<h4 id="CSS-Grid-with-Breakpoints">Explicit CSS Grid Layout with Breakpoints<a href="#CSS-Grid-with-Breakpoints" aria-label="Link to Explicit CSS Grid Layout with Breakpoints"></a></h4>

				<p>
					Using CSS Grid, I like to use the following technique to declaratively define a default CSS grid for our content.
					This is then the CSS which is used for smaller devices.
				</p>

				<h5>CSS for Mobile Devices</h5>

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code used to program the mobile layout Responsive Layout example"><code>.layout {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-areas:
		"header"
		"sidebar"
		"main"
		"sidebar-right"
		"footer";
	grid-template-rows: auto auto 1fr auto auto;
}
.layout > header {
	grid-area: header;
}
.layout > aside:nth-of-type(1) {
	grid-area: sidebar;
}
.layout > main {
	grid-area: main;
}
.layout > aside:nth-of-type(2) {
	grid-area: sidebar-right;
}
.layout > footer {
	grid-area: footer;
}
</code></pre>

				<p>
					Note that this markup explicitly references the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main">
					main</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header">
					header</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer">
					footer</a>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside">
					aside</a> semantic HTML elements in the CSS code.
					This was intentional here, because it forces us to then use the semantic HTML elements and add important landmarks to our web application which improves its accessibility.
					With the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator">child combinator</a> operator (<code>></code>) we ensure that this element targeted is the direct child of the parent with my layout class (which we would probably add directly to our HTML body).
				</p>

				<h5 id="On-Tablets-or-larger-devices">CSS for tablets or larger devices</h5>

				<p>
					Since we have already defined the <code>grid-areas</code> for our HTML elements, we can now declaratively change the layout using a relatively short CSS snippet within a media query:
				</p>

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code used to program the Responsive Layout example for larger devices"><code>@media (min-width: 40rem) { /* Breakpoint Tablet portrait up */
	.layout {
		grid-template-areas:
			"header header header"
			"sidebar main sidebar-right"
			"footer footer footer";
		grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
		grid-template-columns: 20% 1fr 20%;
	}
}
</code></pre>

				<p>
					Note that when you are defining your breakpoints for your application,
					you should consider the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-100-correct-way-to-do-css-breakpoints-88d6a5ba1862/">correct way to do CSS breakpoints</a>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Squishy-Components">Squishy Components<a href="#Squishy-Components" aria-label="Link to Squishy Components"></a></h3>

				<p>
					After we have a responsive layout, the next step is to make sure that all of our components are "squishy".
					This means that when we place a component into a designated area of a layout,
					it should never push itself outside of its designated area.
					Instead it should "squish" down to fit inside of the available space.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is especially important because our layout container assumes that all of its
					content is going to fit, and if this assumption is not true, this could cause the
					whole layout to be wider than the viewport and make it necessary for the user to scroll
					horizontally.
				</p>

				<h4 id="Flexbox--Flex-Wrap">Flexbox + Flex Wrap<a href="#Flexbox--Flex-Wrap" aria-label="Link to Flexbox + Flex Wrap"></a></h4>

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code used to create wrapping within a flexbox container"><code>.container {
	display: flex;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
}
</code></pre>

				<p>
					We can use the <code>display: flex;</code> rule to make the container
					a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">flexbox</a> and
					then use the <code>flex-wrap: wrap;</code> rule to wrap content within the flexbox.
				</p>
				<p>
					When there is not enough space for the items to be placed horizontally,
					they will begin to wrap and be shown stacked vertically instead.
				</p>
				<figure>

							On a larger devices, these block can be positioned next to each other horizontally.
							On smaller devices with flex-wrap activated, the second block containing the price, time and amount
							will wrap onto the next line and be positioned underneath the first block.

					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h4 id="Nested-Flexboxes">Nested Flexboxes<a href="#Nested-Flexboxes" aria-label="Link to Nested Flexboxes"></a></h4>
				<p>
					It is also possible to nest flexboxes inside each other to create more advanced responsive behavior.
					This next example shows the same flex container from our last example, but highlights the
					inner flexbox instead of the outer flexbox.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<div class="horizontal-scroll responsive-example" aria-hidden="true">

						An example highlighting the items in the inner flexbox that can also wrap.
						<p class="visually-hidden">
							The demo shows the same demo as the one in the previous example, but in this instance,
							the price, time, and amount items are highlighted because they are also contained within
							an inner flexbox. This adds an extra layer to the responsiveness: when the viewport gets
							so small that there is no longer space for these three items to be positioned next to each
							other horizontally, they will begin to wrap as well.

				<p>
					We can use the CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeat">repeat</a> function
					with <code>grid-template-columns</code> in order to create an intrinsic grid which will generate as
					many columns as fit in the given space. An example using this type of grid is available in

							The demo shows a grid with 6 different content blocks that are positioned within an intrinsic CSS grid.
							On mobile devices, there is only enough space for a single column, so the blocks are all positioned within

							positioned within the grid in two columns and end up filling three rows.
							When there is enough space for three columns,
							the layout will shift again and the elements will be positioned within the grid in three columns and will
							end up filling two rows. This layout pattern will continue, and a grid will always be generated with

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code for creating a container for larger elements that can be scrolled horizontally"><code>.horizontal-scroll {

</code></pre>

				<p>
					When we talk about creating an application which is responsive, this doesn't mean that we need to optimize
					all of our layouts for small device screens. In certain contexts, we will have larger data representations
					(e.g. tables or code examples), which we also want to be available for smaller devices even if they are not
					optimized for that layout.
				</p>
				<p>
					For this, I like to use a wrapper around tables and code examples which make them able to be scrolled horizontally
					when there is not enough space for them in the current layout.

				<p>
					The following example is a CSS meme now.
					By default, long words in an HTML document will not be hyphenated by default,

					This is especially important when we are dealing with a language which has a lot of long words

				<p>
					We now come to accessibility.
					Here I feel that I can only scratch the surface of the different things that we should consider.
					I also am learning new things all the time, so I'm sure that this list is not exhaustive.
					But I do think it is a good starting off point.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Headings">Headings<a href="#Headings" aria-label="Link to Headings"></a></h3>
				<p>Don’t skip heading levels.</p>
				<p>
					In your HTML Document, you need to ensure that your document hierarchy is complete and doesn't skip levels.
					Otherwise, users who depend on assistive technologies will get confused because it will seem like content is
					missing.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a mistake that many developers make,
					because we pay attention to how the heading appears visually without making sure that an <code>h2</code> is always
					directly followed by a <code>h3</code>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Landmarks">Landmarks<a href="#Landmarks" aria-label="Link to Landmarks"></a></h3>
				<p>
					We should make sure that we use elements like
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main">main</a> and
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header">header</a>
					because then we get HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#Landmark_roles">landmarks</a>
					out of the box.
					This makes the page much easier to navigate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that the <code>main</code> element is not well supported for IE11, so if you have to
					support older browsers, you should also consider using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Main_role#Skip_navigation">skip links</a>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="nav-element">nav Element<a href="#nav-element" aria-label="Link to nav Element"></a></h3>
				<p>
					When you are providing links for a user to navigate within your page (e.g. a navbar or a table of contents),
					you should wrap them in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav">nav</a>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="label-element">label Element<a href="#label-element" aria-label="Link to label Element"></a></h3>
				<p>
					<em>Always</em> add a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label">label</a> to
					let assistive technologies know which data is supposed to be entered in an input field.
				</p>

<pre class="language-html" aria-label="HTML Code showing how to use a label element to wrap around an input field."><code>&lt;label&gt;
	First Name
	&lt;input type="text" value="name" placeholder="Jane" /&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>

				<p>
					Here we either wrap the input field directly in the label,
					or we can use the <code>for</code> attribute and link it to a specific input field.

					Here it is important to not use the <code>placeholder</code> attribute to label the input field.
					The placeholder attribute should be used to show an example of how the data we expect should appear.
					This is particularly important for users who have congnitive disabilities, because when the instructions
					in the placeholder disappear, they may not remember what they were supposed to enter into the field.
					Please also read <a href="https://adamsilver.io/articles/placeholders-are-problematic/">this article about why placeholder are problematic.</a>

					Using lists (an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul">unordered list</a>,
					an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol">ordered list</a>, or a
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl">description list</a>) for things in a UI will also add extra context for assistive technologies.
					For instance, it will tell assistive technologies how many elements are contained in a list.
				</p>
				<p><del datetime="2021-01-22T08:41:57Z">
					In practice, description lists can be difficult to style because we are not allowed to add an extra <code>div</code> as a wrapper around the <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> elements.
					For this reason, I've also done <a href="https://joyheron.com/a11y-playground/represent-labelled-information.html" target="_blank">some experiments about how to best group information in the UI</a>.
					Here there isn't a single correct solution.
					You will have to find out what works best for your UI.

				<p class="insert negative-padding"><ins datetime="2021-01-22T08:41:57Z">
					<em>Update:</em> Originally, I discussed having difficulties styling description lists.
					This statement is no longer correct for modern browsers which implement the
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/grouping-content.html#the-dl-element">HTML 5.2 Recommendation</a>
					because they now allow a <code>div</code> as a wrapper around the <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> elements.

				<h3 id="accordions">Accordions<a href="#aria-expanded-for-developing-Accordions" aria-label="Link to Accordions"></a></h3>

				<p>
					If we need an accordion, or an element which shows/hides a content area,
					we can use the HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details">details</a> element.
				</p>

<pre class="language-html" aria-label="HTML Code example using a details element"><code>&lt;details&gt;
	&lt;summary&gt;Toggle Button&lt;/summary&gt;
	Content which will be expanded/collapsed when clicking the
	summary element
&lt;/details&gt;
</code></pre>

				<p>
					We can also implement this in JavaScript using a <code>button</code> and the
					<code>aria-expanded</code> attribute.
					The <code>aria-expanded</code> attribute adds context information to the <em>button</em> which will tell the screenreader
					if the area that the button is toggling is currently collapsed or expanded.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have seen incorrect implementations of this where the developer thought that the attribute was intended to be added to
					the content block which is expanded or collapsed, but this is not the case and that implementation would be confusing to any user of an assistive technology.
					If we do spend the effort to set aria roles in our application (which we should),
					we need to test our application and make sure they are used correctly!
					No aria usage is better than incorrect aria usage.
				</p>
				<p>
					I have implemented this behavior many times, and when I do, I prefer to use a custom element and activate
					the toggle with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement">progressive enhancement</a>.
					This means that my toggle button is hidden by default before JavaScript is activated, and the content area that is to be collapsed/expanded
					will only be hidden once JavaScript is activated.
				</p>
				<p>
					The contract for the <code>toggle-button</code> component that I usually end up writing therefore usually looks something like this:
				</p>

<pre class="language-html" aria-label="HTML code showing the contract for the toggle-button component"><code>&lt;button is="toggle-button" data-target="#section2"
		  aria-expanded="false" hidden&gt;
		Toggle Section 2
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

				<p><em>aria-expanded</em> is an attribute of the <strong>BUTTON</strong> which tells assistive technologies if the content area that is being expanded/collapsed is currently visible or not.</p>

				<p>
					And my <code>toggle-button</code> implementation usually looks a lot like the following
					(I really need to standardize this and publish a custom element one of these days...):
				</p>

<pre class="language-js" aria-label="JavaScript Code showing an implementation of a toggle button custom element"><code>class ToggleButton extends HTMLButtonElement {
	connectedCallback () {
		this.removeAttribute("hidden");
		if (this.getAttribute("aria-expanded") !== "true") {
			this.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "false");
			this.target.classList.add("hide");
		}
		this.addEventListener("click", this.toggle.bind(this));
	}

	toggle () {
		let classList = this.target.classList;
		if (classList.contains("hide")) {
			classList.remove("hide");
			this.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "true");
		} else {
			classList.add("hide");
			this.setAttribute("aria-expanded", "false");
		}
	}

	get target () {
		return document.querySelector(this.getAttribute("data-target"));
	}
}
customElements.define("toggle-button", ToggleButton, { extends: "button" });
</code></pre>

				<p><a href="https://joyheron.com/a11y-playground/collapser.html" target="_blank">Here is a code demo of this component.</a></p>

				<h3 id="aria-label-and-aria-labelledby">aria-label and aria-labelledby<a href="#aria-label-and-aria-labelledby" aria-label="Link to aria-label and aria-labelledby"></a></h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes we have visual elements which add information to the UI,
					but are missing in the UI. For these cases, we can use
					an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-label_attribute">aria-label</a> attribute
					with a textual description of what the visual element is showing. If there is already a UI
					element available, we can also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-labelledby_attribute">aria-labelledby</a> and reference the HTML id of
					the existing element.
					The HTML <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/title">title</a>
					attribute is not well supported by assistive technologies, so it should not be used to do this.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here it really helps to test your UI in a screenreader so that you can figure out where
					extra labels would be helpful <span aria-label="winking emoji">😉</span>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Hiding-content-visually">Hiding content visually (but not from screenreaders)<a href="#Hiding-content-visually" aria-label="Link to hiding content visually"></a></h3>

<pre class="language-css" aria-label="CSS Code snippet to hide HTML visually"><code>.visually-hidden {
	clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
	clip-path: inset(50%);
	height: 1px;
	overflow: hidden;
	position: absolute;
	white-space: nowrap;
	width: 1px;
}
</code></pre>

				<p>
					Sometimes we want to hide elements from our UI.
					If we use a CSS rule like <code>display: none;</code>
					this not only hides the element visually,
					but also hides it from assistive technologies.
					We can use the previous CSS snippet (or one like it),
					to hide the content visually without removing it from
					the accessibility tree.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Hiding-content-from-assistive-technologies">Hiding content from assistive technologies<a href="#Hiding-content-from-assistive-technologies" aria-label="Link to Hiding Content from Assistive Technologies"></a></h3>
				<p>
					In the same vein, sometimes we add visual elements to our UI which are not necessary
					for assistive technologies and could potentially cause confusion or unnecessary noise.
					This could be the case, for instance, when we add icons to our visual design in addition
					to existing textual labels. We may then want to hide these from assistive technologies
					using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-hidden_attribute">aria-hidden</a> attribute.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Image-Alt">Descriptive alt text for images<a href="#Image-Alt" aria-label="Link to Descriptive alt text for images"></a></h3>
				<p>
					When using images in a user interface, we need to set
					the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt">alt</a> attribute for the image.
					This alt-text should provide a description of the same information that we are trying to
					convey visually with the image that we have chosen.
					<a href="https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/">This guide provides more information about alt-texts.</a>
				</p>

				<h3 id="Styling-Focus">Adding clear focus styles<a href="#Styling-Focus" aria-label="Link to Adding clear focus styles"></a></h3>
				<p>
					By default, the browser will add focus styles to the UI to indicate to users which element on the
					screen is currently active. This is especially important for keyboard users, who need the focus styles
					in order to correctly navigate throughout your page.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you find the default focus styles irritating in your design, you can customize them with the
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus">:focus</a> CSS pseudo-selector.
					However, here it is very important that <strong>you still provide a focus style which has a high
						contrast and is easily identifiable</strong> within the UI.
				</p>

				<h3 id="Setting-focus-correctly">Setting focus correctly<a href="#Setting-focus-correctly" aria-label="Link to setting focus correctly"></a></h3>
				<p>
					As long as you are writing only HTML and CSS,
					there isn't any good reason why you would want to mess with the <code>focus</code> within your webpage,
					because the semantics and structure of HTML is very well designed.
					However, when we begin to modify the HTML of our application with client-side JavaScript,
					we need to think about the focus and if we need to update it as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, if we are adding content to our DOM with JavaScript,
					as I did with this
					<a href="https://joyheron.com/a11y-playground/show-more-pagination.html" target="_blank">“Show More” Pagination Example</a>,
					we should consider whether we should move the focus to the new content after it has loaded.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this case, we need to <strong>make absolutely sure</strong> that you
					<strong>test the application with a screenreader and keyboard</strong>
					to ensure that the focus is set correctly.
					There is little that can break your UI more than incorrectly setting the focus.
